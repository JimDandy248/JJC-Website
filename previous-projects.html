        <p class="project-description">This smaller deck is thoughtfully designed to complement the house, using modern, 
            durable materials built to last. Attention to detail shines through in the clean lines, 
            clearance, and transition between the deck and the backyard. 
            A new sidewalk connects the deck to both the driveway and the front of the house, 
            creating a seamless and inviting outdoor space.
